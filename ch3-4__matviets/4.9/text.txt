No Collections Operations
It's 2015. Java and JavaScript have map and filter on collections. Go doesn't. This is stupid and wrong on its face.

How wrong? Well, so insanely stupidly wrong that I have no idea what the Go designers were thinking.

Didn't they spend, you know, 10 minutes with ANY OTHER LANGUAGE? map and filter are JUST WHAT YOU DO with collections.
